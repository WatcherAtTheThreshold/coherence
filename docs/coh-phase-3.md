## Things That Might Need Addressing

### 1. **Distortion Spread Tuning**

The reviews all flagged this - exponential growth is too aggressive. You mentioned switching to "one distortion spreads per cycle" - have you tested that yet? Might be the single biggest balance lever.

### 2. **Artifact Effects - Are They Distinct Enough?**

Right now you have:

* **Resonance Inverter** \- flips distortion/anchor meaning
* **Clarity Lens** \- \+1 drain per turn \(is this impactful enough?\)
* **Severance** \- immune to distortion\, anchors don't work

Do these feel different enough in practice? Or does one always dominate? Worth playtesting which ones people actually pick vs. skip.

### 3. **The Coherence Economy**

* Starting: 20
* Movement: -1
* Artifacts: +6 each
* Anchor: +10 (one-time)

Does this math support getting 2-3 artifacts before the spread overwhelms you? Might need paper prototyping with the new spread rate.

### 4. **First-Time Player Experience**

How does someone learn this game? Right now the instructions say "FIND ARTIFACT TO UNLOCK EXIT" - is that enough? Or do you need a tiny tutorial overlay on first load?

### 5. **The Threshold Message**

You've got "NO RETURN" but the mechanics don't enforce it (you can cross back up). The reviews caught this. Do you:

* Actually block upward crossing after threshold?
* Keep it symbolic but honest about it?
* Make crossing back UP cost extra coherence?

### 6. **Audio Escalation**

You've got music shift at threshold - super effective. Could you also have:

* Low coherence (<5) add distortion/glitching to the music?
* Different sounds for each artifact pickup?
* Subtle audio cue when distortions spread?

### 7. **Mobile Experience**

The touch controls are in there - have you actually tested on a phone? Does the grid scale well? Do the modals work?

## My Top 3 "Do Next" Candidates

If I were prioritizing for next session:

1. **Implement the 3-tier ending system** (you just designed it, strike while hot!)
2. **Test the single-distortion spread** (biggest mechanical question mark)
3. **Sketch out what Map 2 and Map 3 layouts look like** (cement the variety concept)
