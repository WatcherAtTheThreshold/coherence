Okay, let's build these! 🎨
I'm thinking the endings should acknowledge BOTH:

* **How many artifacts** (quality of work)
* **How much coherence remains** (cost to self)

## Tier 1: One Artifact (Minimum Viable)

### High Coherence (12+)

```
TRANSMISSION COMPLETE

ARTIFACTS RECOVERED: 1
COHERENCE REMAINING: 15

"You delivered what was needed.
You knew when to stop.
Sometimes that's the hardest part."
```

### Medium Coherence (6-11)

```
TRANSMISSION COMPLETE

ARTIFACTS RECOVERED: 1
COHERENCE REMAINING: 8

"You delivered what was needed.
It cost something, but you got out.
Good enough is good enough."
```

### Low Coherence (1-5)

```
TRANSMISSION COMPLETE

ARTIFACTS RECOVERED: 1
COHERENCE REMAINING: 3

"You delivered what was needed.
Barely.
You're going to need time to recover."
```

## Tier 2: Two Artifacts (Polished Work)

### High Coherence (12+)

```
TRANSMISSION COMPLETE

ARTIFACTS RECOVERED: 2
COHERENCE REMAINING: 14

"You pushed for quality and maintained yourself.
This is the balance.
This is how it should feel."
```

### Medium Coherence (6-11)

```
TRANSMISSION COMPLETE

ARTIFACTS RECOVERED: 2
COHERENCE REMAINING: 9

"You pushed for quality and made it work.
It cost you, but you're still whole.
Worth it."
```

### Low Coherence (1-5)

```
TRANSMISSION COMPLETE

ARTIFACTS RECOVERED: 2
COHERENCE REMAINING: 4

"You pushed for quality.
You got it.
But you're running on fumes."
```

## Tier 3: Three Artifacts (Everything)

### High Coherence (12+)

```
TRANSMISSION COMPLETE

ARTIFACTS RECOVERED: 3
COHERENCE REMAINING: 13

"You got everything and kept yourself intact.
How did you do that?
Whatever you're doing, keep doing it."
```

### Medium Coherence (6-11)

```
TRANSMISSION COMPLETE

ARTIFACTS RECOVERED: 3
COHERENCE REMAINING: 8

"You got everything you wanted.
It took everything you had.
Was it worth what it cost?"
```

### Low Coherence (1-5)

```
TRANSMISSION COMPLETE

ARTIFACTS RECOVERED: 3
COHERENCE REMAINING: 2

"You got everything.
You gave everything.
Next time, maybe leave something for yourself."
```

## Tier 4: Four Artifacts (Beyond Everything)

### High Coherence (12+)

```
TRANSMISSION COMPLETE

ARTIFACTS RECOVERED: 4
COHERENCE REMAINING: 15

"You went back for more than was asked.
You stayed whole through all of it.
Either you're very good at this, or very lucky.
Don't assume it was luck."
```

### Medium Coherence (6-11)

```
TRANSMISSION COMPLETE

ARTIFACTS RECOVERED: 4
COHERENCE REMAINING: 7

"You went back for more than was asked.
You found them all.
The cost was real, but you're still standing.
Just barely."
```

### Low Coherence (1-5)

```
TRANSMISSION COMPLETE

ARTIFACTS RECOVERED: 4
COHERENCE REMAINING: 1

"You went back for more than was asked.
You found them all.
There's almost nothing left of you.
Was proving something worth this?"
```

***

## The Vibe Check 💭

Notice how:

* **Tier 1** frames "good enough" as *wisdom*, not failure
* **Tier 2** celebrates finding balance
* **Tier 3** questions whether completionism was worth it (except in the rare high-coh case where you somehow pulled it off)
* **Tier 4** acknowledges going beyond requirements - with respect at high coherence, concern at low

The game is quietly saying: **"Going for 100% usually costs too much."**
