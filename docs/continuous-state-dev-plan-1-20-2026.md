## Title: Continuous State

# The Balance / Coherence Loop — Expanded

Think of this game as a **living equilibrium system**, not a puzzle to solve but a *state to tend*.

Game starts with a start screen to actuate music.

***

## 1\. Coherence as a Continuous State \(not a score\)

Instead of “points,” Coherence is a **field condition** of the grid.

### Coherence Meter (0–100, but hidden or softly implied)

* You *feel* coherence more than you read it
* Music, motion, and subtle visual cues communicate state

#### Coherence increases when:

* Tiles are **fully supported**
* Structures **settle into stillness**
* Pressure is **evenly distributed**
* Motion resolves cleanly

#### Coherence decreases when:

* Tiles float or overhang
* Stress stacks vertically
* Tiles collide violently
* Motion becomes chaotic or cascading

> Importantly:
> **Coherence is about harmony, not perfection.**

A messy-but-stable pile can be highly coherent.

***

## 2\. Structural Stress \(the hidden math\)

Each tile contributes **stress** downward.
A simple mental model:

* Every tile has a **weight**
* Weight transfers straight down
* Unsupported or uneven stress causes instability

### You don’t need real physics—just rules:

* If a tile has:
    * no tile below → *fall*
    * partial support → *strain*
    * too much weight above → *fracture or slide*

This lets the system *decide* things without randomness.

***

## 3\. Instability Behaviors \(very important\)

Instability should feel **organic**, not punishing.

### Possible instability outcomes:

* **Sliding**: tiles shift sideways to find support
* **Cracking**: a tile breaks into lighter pieces
* **Avalanche**: a vertical collapse propagates downward
* **Settling**: the system resolves itself without player input

Key rule:

> Instability is not failure—it is feedback.

***

## 4\. Player Action: Gentle Intervention

The player does not “fix” the grid.
They **intervene**.

### Constraints that keep it quiet:

* You can only drag **one tile at a time**
* Dragging costs a small amount of coherence
* Moving a tile pauses gravity *only locally*

This creates a rhythm:

> Observe → intervene → watch → wait

Waiting is gameplay.

***

## 5\. The Music States \(this is the heart\)

You already have **two music states**, which is *perfect*.

### State 1: Simple (High Coherence) - Ambient.mp3

* Sparse
* Slow tempo
* Fewer layers
* Long decay
* Emphasizes stillness

Triggered when:

* Few tiles are moving
* Stress is evenly distributed
* Player input is minimal

This is the *reward* state.

***

### State 2: Complex (Low Coherence) - Ambient2.mp3

* More layers
* Irregular rhythms
* Slight dissonance
* Shorter loops or evolving phrases

Triggered when:

* Multiple tiles are falling or sliding
* Fractures occur
* Cascades propagate

Important:

> This music is not “danger music”
> It’s **weather**

***

### Transition Rule (crucial)

The music should **crossfade**, never hard switch.
The player learns:

> “When I move too much, the world becomes loud.”

That’s Coherence, embodied.

***

## 6\. Failure Without Failure

There doesn’t need to be a “Game Over.”
Instead:

### Low Coherence State

* The grid becomes increasingly self-active
* Player actions become less effective
* Gravity feels stronger
* Structures resist being “saved”

Eventually:

* The system reaches a **new equilibrium**
* Or collapses into a dense, inert mass

That *is* the ending.
No shame. No loss screen.

***

## 7\. Success Without Winning

Possible session goals:

* Maintain high coherence for X minutes
* Guide the grid back from chaos
* Reach a moment of total stillness

Or:

> The player decides when they are done.

A quiet “Rest” button that fades out the world and music.

***

## 8\. Visual Feedback \(no UI clutter\)

Instead of meters:

* Tiles subtly **vibrate** under strain
* Hairline cracks appear
* Shadows deepen where stress accumulates
* Settled tiles slightly desaturate or warm

The grid *speaks*.

***

## 9\. Why this works \(Muse\-level truth\)

This loop:

* Respects patience
* Rewards restraint
* Makes chaos meaningful
* Lets *listening* be gameplay

It aligns with:

* Your **Coherence concept**
* Your interest in **non-violent systems**
* Your instinct toward **music as state, not soundtrack**

This is not a puzzle game.
It’s a **system you keep company with**.

***

## Where we can go next (pick one)

1. **Formalize the math** (weights, thresholds, fractures)
2. **Design the first “perfect” starting grid**
3. **Define tile archetypes** (stone, soil, memory, void)
4. **Map music parameters directly to grid variables**
5. **Prototype ruleset in plain English or pseudocode**

Just tell me which thread to pull—and I’ll pull it *gently*.
