# Daily Routine

*(working title, game plan)*

A 2-D game that simulates creating.

Music is daily-routine.mp3 in /music

## 1\. Core Vision

**Daily Routine** is about completing a project while balancing and integrating many others.

There is no failure state.
There is no winning.

Instead, the player is guided by a small wizard‑like character (robotic, calm, and observant) who reflects on the story as it unfolds.

Tasks include:

* writing 
* music
* drawing
* coding
* painting
* woodworking


The experience should feel:

* Cozy
* Slow
* Safe
* Curious
* Slightly magical

## 2\. Core Gameplay Loop

1. Player goes to one of **3 stations**
2. Each Station represents one or more **projects — station 1: Music at keyboard, station 2: drawing and coding and writing at PC work desk, station 3: Painting and woodworking at an assembly table**
3. Player selects **1 Project**
4. Player Plays a mini-game that represents work 
5. Then you can combine some projects
    * coding
    * combine music
6. you get a score from mini games

## 3\. Mini\-Games

### Mini-Game Types (initial)

* 1\. Music Composition: "The Pulse Weaver"
    Instead of a complex DAW (Digital Audio Workstation), focus on **rhythmic synchronization** and **layering**.
    * **The Mechanic:** A "Radial Sequencer." Players place different colored "nodes" on a spinning circle. As the playhead sweeps around the circle, it hits the nodes to play sounds.
    * **The Challenge:** You must match the "Vibe Meter." If the meter asks for "Melancholy," you have to move your nodes to minor keys or slower intervals.
    * **The Hook:** Successfully layering a bass line, a melody, and percussion creates a sudden "drop" where the visual environment transforms.

    ## 2\. Drawing: "Line of Action"

    Focus on the **fluidity and gesture** of sketching rather than pixel-perfect accuracy.
    * **The Mechanic:** "Path Tracing." A ghost-like silhouette of a pose appears briefly. You must draw a single, continuous line (the "Action Line") that captures the energy of that pose within a time limit.
    * **The Challenge:** Your "Ink Supply" is limited. Short, jagged strokes use more ink than smooth, confident ones.
    * **The Hook:** At the end of the round, the game "auto-fills" your gesture line into a fully rendered character sketch based on how accurate your line was.

    ## 3\. Coding: "Logic Leak"

    Represent coding as **flow control** and **problem-solving** rather than typing syntax.
    * **The Mechanic:** "Pipe Logic." Data packets (glowing orbs) flow from an Input to an Output. You must place "Functions" (blocks) that modify the data—like a "Splitter" to double the orbs or a "Filter" to change their color.
    * **The Challenge:** A "Bug" (a red virus) is chasing the data through the pipes. You have to reroute the flow or wrap the data in "Encryption" blocks to protect it.
    * **The Hook:** It feels like a high-speed puzzle game where "compiling" your solution triggers a satisfying chain reaction.

    ## 4\. Painting: "The Chroma Alchemist"

    Focus on the **physics of color mixing** and **layering textures**.
    * **The Mechanic:** "Pigment Hurling." You have a palette of primary colors. You must "slingshot" blobs of paint onto a canvas to hit specific targets.
    * **The Challenge:** To get Green, you have to collide a Yellow blob and a Blue blob in mid-air right before they hit the canvas. You also have to manage "Drip Physics"—if you use too much paint in one spot, it starts to run.
    * **The Hook:** The "Wash" mechanic—using a digital sponge to blend your chaotic splashes into a beautiful, soft-focus landscape.

    ## 5\. Woodworking: "Grain & Gauge"

    Focus on **precision** and the **subtractive nature** of the craft.
    * **The Mechanic:** "Lathe Spin." A block of wood spins on the screen. You use a chisel tool to shave off layers.
    * **The Challenge:** You have to follow a dotted "Cut Line." If you press too hard, the wood splinters (lowering durability); if you're too light, you run out of time. You must also account for the "Grain Direction," which changes the vibration of your controller/mouse.
    * **The Hook:** The final step is "Sanding & Polishing," where a quick-rubbing mini-game reveals the high-gloss "grain" of the piece you just made.

##  6\. Writing: "The Stream of Consciousness" \(Creative Flow\)

This treats writing like a **high-speed racing or rhythm game**, focusing on the "Flow State."

* **The Visuals:** You control a cursor (the "Pen") flying down a tunnel of blank paper. As you type or move, ink trails behind you.
* **The Mechanic:** "Thought Orbs" float toward you. You have to "catch" them in the right order to form a coherent sentence.
* **The Challenge: The Inner Critic.** A shadowy figure or a wall of "Writer’s Block" occasionally closes in from the sides. You have to "dash" through it by hitting a series of keys rapidly or finding a "Metaphor Power-up" to blast through.
* **Game Feel:** As your "WPM" (Words Per Minute) increases, the music swells, the colors get more vibrant, and the ink trail becomes more ornate.
* **The Sound:** A rhythmic, typewriter-style clack that syncs with the background music.
