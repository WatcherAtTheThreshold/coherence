**Start with 3 hand-crafted maps**, each with a different "personality":
**Map 1: "The Tight Deadline"**

* Artifacts clustered deep
* Narrow paths, lots of distortions
* Anchor placement forces hard routing choice

**Map 2: "The Scope Sprawl"**

* Artifacts spread wide
* Looks easy but requires lots of movement (coh drain)
* Tempting optional content

**Map 3: "The Gauntlet"**

* Linear-ish path with clear escalation
* Each artifact is progressively riskier
* Very explicit "how far do you go?" structure

This gives you:

* Variety for replayability
* Control over experience quality
* Different emotional flavors of the same core tension
* Manageable scope (each map is just a different 13×13 layout)

Then, if you want to experiment with proc-gen later, you'll have 3 solid examples to inform what "good generation" looks like.
